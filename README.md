# Lexical Analyzer
This project implements a lexical analyzer in C/C++ that identifies lexemes and their corresponding tokens from a source code file provided by the user. The analyzer prints each lexeme/token pair to the screen, handling errors gracefully and providing detailed feedback.

Problem Statement
The lexical analyzer processes a source code file written in a custom programming language. The program:

Accepts the file path as a required command-line argument.
Reads and tokenizes the file's contents.
Outputs the lexemes and their associated tokens to the terminal.
